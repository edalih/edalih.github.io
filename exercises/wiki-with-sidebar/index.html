                    <b><i>The Last of Us</i></b> is a 2013 action-adventure 
                    game developed by Naughty Dog and published by Sony 
                    Computer Entertainment. Players control Joel, a 
                    smuggler tasked with escorting a teenage girl, 
                    Ellie, across a post-apocalyptic United States. 
                    <i>The Last of Us</i> is played from a third-person 
                    perspective. Players use firearms and improvised 
                    weapons and can use stealth to defend against 
                    hostile humans and cannibalistic creatures infected 
                    by a mutated fungus. In the online multiplayer mode, 
                    up to eight players engage in cooperative and 
                    competitive gameplay.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Development of <i>The Last of Us</i> began in 2009, soon 
                    after the release of Naughty Dog's previous game, 
                    <i>Uncharted 2: Among Thieves.</i> For the first time in 
                    the company's history, Naughty Dog split into two 
                    teams; while one team developed <i>Uncharted 3: 
                    Drake's Deception</i>, the other half developed 
                    <i>The Last of Us</i>. The relationship between Joel 
                    and Ellie became the focus, with all other 
                    elements developed around it. Actors Troy Baker 
                    and Ashley Johnson portrayed Joel and Ellie, 
                    respectively, through voice and motion capture, 
                    and assisted creative director Neil Druckmann 
                    with the development of the characters and story. 
                    The original score was composed and performed by 
                    Gustavo Santaolalla.

                    Following its announcement in December 2011, <i>The Last 
                    of Us</i> was widely anticipated. It was released for the 
                    PlayStation 3 in June 2013. It received critical 
                    acclaim, with praise for its narrative, gameplay, 
                    visuals, sound design, score, characterization, 
                    and depiction of female characters. <i>The Last of Us</i> 
                    became one of the best-selling video games, selling 
                    over 1.3 million units in its first week and 17 
                    million by April 2018. The game won year-end 
                    accolades, including multiple Game of the Year 
                    awards from several gaming publications, critics, 
                    and game award ceremonies. It has been ranked as one 
                    of the greatest video games ever made.

                    Naughty Dog released several downloadable content 
                    additions; <i>The Last of Us: Left Behind</i> adds a 
                    single-player campaign following Ellie and her 
                    best friend, Riley. A remastered version, <i>The Last 
                    of Us Remastered</i>, was released for the PlayStation 
                    4 in July 2014.[a] A remake, <i>The Last of Us Part I</i>, 
                    was released in September 2022 for PlayStation 5 
                    and in March 2023 for Windows. A sequel, <i>The Last 
                    of Us Part II</i>, was released in 2020. Other The Last 
                    of Us media includes a comic book in 2013, a live 
                    show in 2014, a television adaptation by HBO in 2023,

                    <i>The Last of Us</i> is an action-adventure game played 
                    from a third-person perspective. The player 
                    traverses post-apocalyptic environments such as 
                    towns, buildings, forests, and sewers to advance 
                    the story. The player can use firearms, improvised 
                    weapons, hand-to-hand combat, and stealth to defend 
                    against hostile humans and cannibalistic creatures 
                    infected by a mutated strain of the Cordyceps 
                    fungus. For most of the game, the player takes 
                    control of Joel, a man tasked with escorting a 
                    young girl, Ellie, across the United States. 
                    The player also controls Ellie throughout the 
                    game's winter segment and briefly controls 
                    Joel's daughter, Sarah, in the opening sequence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In combat, the player can use long-range weapons, 
                    such as a rifle, a shotgun, and a bow, and 
                    short-range weapons such as a handgun and a 
                    short-barreled shotgun. The player is able to 
                    scavenge limited-use melee weapons, such as pipes 
                    and baseball bats, and throw bottles and bricks 
                    to distract, stun, or attack enemies. The 
                    player can upgrade weapons at workbenches using 
                    collected items. Equipment such as health kits, 
                    shivs, and Molotov cocktails can be found or 
                    crafted using collected items. Attributes such 
                    as the health meter and crafting speed can be 
                    upgraded by collecting pills and medicinal plants. 
                    Health can be recharged by finding edible items 
                    or through the use of health kits.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Though the player can attack enemies directly, 
                    they can also use stealth to attack undetected 
                    or sneak by them. "Listen Mode" allows the player 
                    to locate enemies through a heightened sense of 
                    hearing and spatial awareness, indicated as 
                    outlines visible through walls and objects. In 
                    the dynamic cover system, the player can crouch 
                    behind obstacles to gain a tactical advantage 
                    during combat. The game features periods 
                    without combat, often involving conversation 
                    between the characters. The player can solve 
                    simple puzzles, such as using floating pallets 
                    to move Ellie, who is unable to swim, across 
                    bodies of water and using ladders or dumpsters 
                    to reach higher areas. Story collectibles, such 
                    as notes, maps and comics, can be scavenged and 
                    viewed in the backpack menu.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The game features an artificial intelligence 
                    system by which hostile human enemies react to 
                    combat. If enemies discover the player, they may 
                    take cover or call for assistance, and can take 
                    advantage of the player when they are distracted, 
                    out of ammunition, or in a fight. Player companions, 
                    such as Ellie, can assist in combat by throwing 
                    objects at threats to stun them, announcing the 
                    location of unseen enemies, or using a knife and 
                    pistol to attack enemies.

                <p>
                    The online multiplayer mode, called Factions, 
                    allows up to eight players to engage in 
                    competitive gameplay in rearranged versions of 
                    multiple single-player settings. The game 
                    features three multiplayer game types: Supply 
                    Raid and Survivors are both team deathmatches, 
                    with the latter excluding the ability to respawn; 
                    Interrogation features teams investigating the 
                    location of the enemy team's lockbox, and the 
                    first to capture said lockbox wins. In every 
                    mode, players select a faction—Hunters (a group 
                    of hostile survivors) or Fireflies (a revolutionary 
                    militia group)—and keep their clan alive by 
                    collecting supplies during matches. Each match 
                    is equal to one day; by surviving twelve "weeks", 
                    players have completed a journey and can re-select 
                    their Faction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Players earn "parts" by marking or killing enemies, 
                    healing or reviving allies, crafting items, and 
                    unlocking the enemy lockbox. Parts can be spent 
                    mid-match on weapon upgrades and armor, and are 
                    converted to supplies at the end of the match; 
                    additional supplies can be scavenged from enemies' 
                    bodies. Players also earn points as they play, 
                    which can be spent on weapons or skills to create 
                    custom loadouts. Players could originally 
                    connect the game to their Facebook account, altering 
                    clan members' names and faces to match their 
                    Facebook friends. Players have the ability to 
                    customize their characters with hats, helmets, masks, 
                    and emblems. The multiplayer servers for the 
                    PlayStation 3 version of the game were shut down 
                    on September 3, 2019.

                    In 2013, an outbreak of a mutant Cordyceps fungus 
                    ravages the United States, transforming its human 
                    hosts into aggressive creatures. Twenty years later, 
                    civilization has been decimated by the infection. 
                    Joel works as a smuggler with his partner, Tess 
                    (Annie Wersching), in a quarantine zone in Boston, 
                    Massachusetts. They hunt down Robert (Robin Atkin 
                    Downes), a black-market dealer, to recover a stolen 
                    weapons cache. Before Tess kills him, Robert reveals 
                    he traded the cache with the Fireflies, a rebel 
                    militia opposing the quarantine zone authorities. 
                    The Fireflies' leader, Marlene (Merle Dandridge), 
                    promises to double their cache in return for 
                    smuggling a teenage girl, Ellie (Ashley Johnson), 
                    to Fireflies hiding in the Massachusetts State 
                    House. While sneaking out at night, Joel and Tess 
                    discover Ellie is infected; she claims she is 
                    immune and may lead to a cure. At the State House, 
                    the trio discover the Fireflies have been killed 
                    and Tess reveals she has been infected. Believing 
                    in Ellie's importance, she sacrifices herself 
                    against pursuing soldiers so Joel and Ellie can 
                    escape. Joel decides to find Tommy, a former 
                    Firefly, in the hope that he can locate others.
