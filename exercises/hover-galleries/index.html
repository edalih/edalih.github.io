                        Distinctive characteristics. Butterflies (and moths) 
                        are the only group of insects that have scales 
                        covering their wings, although some butterflies 
                        have reduced scales. They differ from other insects 
                        also by their ability to coil up their proboscis.

                        Numbers of species. Due to their bright colors and 
                        visits to flowers, butterflies are the most familiar 
                        of insects to humans. There are about 17,500 
                        species of butterflies in the world, and around 
                        750 species in the United States.

                        Migration. Butterfly migration is best exemplified 
                        by the Monarch, which is widely known to migrate 
                        in the fall to overwintering sites in California 
                        and Mexico. But in the United States, several 
                        other butterfly species engage in lesser migration 
                        distances. Some of these are the Buckeye, the 
                        Painted Lady, the Purple Wing, the Great Southern 
                        White, the Cloudless Sulphur, and the Little Sulphur.

                <h3>Wing Colors</h3>
                <div class="card-content">
                    <p>
                        Wing colors in butterflies appear in two types, 
                        pigment and structural, frequently combined in one 
                        individual. Pigment colors are familiar in paints, 
                        dyes, and inks, and are defined as specific 
                        substances with definite chemical composition. 
                        Structural colors are instead produced in a 
                        physical manner, similar to a rainbow. Morpho 
                        butterflies are the usual example of butterflies 
                        with structural color.
