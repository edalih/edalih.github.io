                <p>
                    Mr. Wrinlkes is a little kitten found all by himself 
                    in a small box near the highway. Although hairless
                    cats are usually easily rehomed, Mr. Wrinlkes has been
                    with us for a few weeks now due to him being deaf.
                    Despite that, he is still a sweet little guy who is 
                    always excited to see us and always ready to make
                    homemade biscuits.

            <h3>Hairless Cat Care</h3>
            <p>
                Hairless cats have been popular for decades. This in 
                part to their friendly, sociable, almost dog-like at 
                times demeanor. However, whichever breed of hairless 
                cat your have your heart set on, there are things 
                you should know about their care before you launch 
                headlong into hairless cat ownership. A life without 
                fur can require more upkeep than one might initially 
                think.
            </p>

                Just like people, cat's produce oils in their skin. 
                A hairless cat is not able to wick these oils away 
                from the skin like a furred cat would be able to do. 
                As a result, your hairless cat will accumulate these 
                oils on their skin. To help clean these oils off, 
                hairless cats require weekly baths with warm water 
                and an over-the-counter, hypoallergenic pet shampoo 
                that is free of dyes and perfumes. When bathing, it 
                is important to ensure that all the shampoo is 
                thoroughly rinsed off of your cat, as any residual 
                shampoo left on the skin for an extended period may 
                cause irritation.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is equally important to ensure that your cat is 
                sufficiently dried after bath time so that they don't 
                get too cold. A simple, gentle pat-down with a towel 
                should do the trick. When not bathed routinely (and 
                sometimes even if you have a bath schedule set) hairless 
                cats can get acne and blackhead breakouts just like 
                people. If your cat does have a breakout, you can clean 
                the area with warm water and mild antibacterial soap. 
                If that doesn't help, a trip to the vet to help get the 
                breakout in check might be in order.

                Furred cats not only benefit from fur wicking away the 
                natural oils in their skin, but the fur in the ears 
                also wicks away dirt and debris. Without this fur, the 
                ears of a hairless cat can get quite dirty quite 
                quickly. As with routine bathing, routine ear cleaning 
                (something that could be easily done at the same time 
                as a bath) helps prevent ear infections from excess 
                ear debris. To clean your cat's ears, you will need 
                over the counter pet ear cleaner, cotton balls, or 
                cotton rounds. Some tutorials will have your add the 
                cleaner directly into the ear and there is nothing 
                wrong with that method, but most cats aren't very 
                happy about having the cleaner squirted into their 
                ear canal. These cats may be more amenable to you 
                first saturating a cotton ball or cotton round with 
                the ear cleaner and then wiping debris away with the 
                soaked cotton.
