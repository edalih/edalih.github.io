                <p>
                    Hubba and Bubba are sugar gliders that came from a 
                    home of someone who could no longer care for them. 
                    They are only a few weeks old so they require a little 
                    extra care.

            <h3>Sugar Glider Care</h3>
            <p>
                Sugar gliders are very unique animals that many people 
                in the general public don’t even know exist. Over the 
                past 15 years, they have been domesticated and are now 
                known to make great little pets! If you are interested 
                in bringing a sugar glider into your home, here is what 
                you need to know.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sugar gliders are native to places like Australia and 
                Indonesia. They are not rodents as some would assume, 
                but are marsupials, meaning they raise their young in 
                a pouch on the mother’s belly, similar to a kangaroo. 
                They are nocturnal animals which means that they sleep 
                through the day and are awake and active at night.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sugar gliders get their name from the fact that they 
                love eating sweet, sugary foods (especially fruits and 
                vegetables) and that they have a thin membrane that 
                stretches from their wrists to their ankles, much like 
                a flying squirrel, that allows them to jump and glide 
                through the air. In the wild, they can glide from tree 
                to tree at a distance of up to 150 feet!
            </p>
            <p>
                Adult sugar gliders weigh between 4-5 ounces and usually 
                measure around 12 inches from nose to the tip of the 
                tail. The tail is responsible for at least half of its 
                length. These creatures are quite vocal and can bark 
                somewhat like a small dog. When cared for properly, 
                they can live in captivity up to 15 years.
            </p>
                Because they naturally live in colonies of 10-15 other 
                sugar gliders, they are considered social animals and 
                usually do better in homes if they are in pairs. This 
                is also why they have the instinct to bond with an entire 
                group and tend to do very well in a family setting, 
                including with children and other pets. They usually end 
                up having a favorite person in the family that they bond 
                the strongest with, most commonly whoever handles them 
                the most.
