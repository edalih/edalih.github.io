            <h3>Raccoon Care</h3>
            <p>
                As nice as letting a pet raccoon roam free in your house 
                sounds, it is not always a realistic possibility. While 
                not intentionally destructive, a raccoon’s natural curiosity 
                and playfulness very well be the downfall of many of your 
                prized possessions should you chose to let your pet roam 
                free. Never fear, though, because raccoon enclosures are 
                an option! We would like to make it clear, however, that 
                when we say “raccoon enclosure,” we do not mean a tiny 
                raccoon cage or even a commercial sized catio. For one, 
                raccoons need a lot of room to run and play. They are 
                both incredibly smart and active animals, and prone to 
                obesity in captivity. Keeping your pet raccoon in a cage 
                like that just isn’t fair to them. Instead, raccoon rooms 
                or large outdoor enclosures are perfect choices for when 
                you want a raccoon but don’t want your whole house to 
                look like a tornado has come through. Raccoon rooms and 
                enclosures are also fun to design and give you endless 
                possibilities to keep your raccoon entertained!
            </p>
            <p>
                When keeping your raccoon inside, it is highly 
                recommended to change the walls in the raccoon room 
                to paneling or something stronger than sheetrock as 
                pet raccoons will pick at sheetrock until they’ve torn 
                holes in the wall.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also, while pet raccoons are litter trainable, I still 
                wouldn’t use carpet. Raccoons will pick at it and possibly 
                even get their nails hung. As raccoons love spending time 
                with their humans, baby-proofing your entire house is 
                ideal. This especially applies to cabinets and toilets. 
                When you can’t be around to watch, giving your a safe 
                bedroom or even possibly an outdoor enclosure is best. 
                A raccoon room or enclosure is fun place to give them 
                lots of enrichment too. You can build them climbing 
                structures, hanging swings or other toys, and even 
                giving a pond or wheel. Keep in mind though variety 
                is key. Switching out toys from time to time will keep 
                your pet raccoon from becoming bored and destructive.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since pet raccoons generally litter train pretty easy, 
                a litterbox in the rooms they have access too is also 
                needed. Keep in mind that pet raccoons shouldn’t have 
                regular cat litter. Regular cat litter hurts a raccoon’s 
                sensitive paws and can cause an impaction if they eat it 
                while cleaning themselves. Better alternatives to cat 
                litter are corn cob bedding and pine pellet horse bedding.
