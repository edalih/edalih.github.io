                        Through trying different design programs and
                        design styles, I'v been able to expand my knowledge
                        of all art.

                        Architecture Illustration really drew me in from the 
                        first project I did with it. Now it's one of my
                        favorite things to illustrate.

                        Photoshop has been probably one of the harder things
                        for me to learn but it is absolutely one of
                        my favorite things to work with. Creating absract 
                        designs using real world things is an incredible 
                        way to show your inner thoughts.
